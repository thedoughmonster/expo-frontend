## Schema Verification Checklist
- [ ] I fetched the latest schema documentation from the worker before starting any API-related changes.
- [ ] I ran the schema verification suite and confirmed it passed before modifying code that consumes API responses.
- [ ] I avoided regex parsing of API payloads, undocumented field guesses, and schema mutations without documentation updates.
